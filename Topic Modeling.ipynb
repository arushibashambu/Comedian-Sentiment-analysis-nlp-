stand up special delves into her sexual adventures hoarding the rocky road to pregnancy and why feminism is terrible\\t\\t ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage ali wonghi hello welcome thank you thank you for coming hello hello we are gonna have to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in like ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for comingum its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that uh i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating throughand then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find outum i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like you never know when you might need this and i was like but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of successi grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was like oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had we had so much chemistry he was like hey wassup i was like wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like hey can you drop me off i was like where he was like at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like oh no i just fucked a homeless dude againmy husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude you know you feel like youre in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and its very you know its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement you know just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im like i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer you knowbut i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on you knowmy last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its like making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre like i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes fromi think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was like its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abusedi grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats like a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were like oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the househim and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre like im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always like oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i waspeople are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013 like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be like we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre like but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn ita lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be like look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im like that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retiredi do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day like youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre like oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they wantyou know its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was like you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit togethermy fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was like why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just lets redecoratei gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to youi broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like uh youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really you know freaked out about anal and theyre like oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel like youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like oh my god its like im going back in time\\u266a a whole new world \\u266ait was magicala big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye like hes discovered nirvana and its like youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you knowmy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what

all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteranso i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be like guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was like yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won you knowanother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was like yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and you know why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were like yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im like oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here you knowi need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre like im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevityi also decided to have a kid because uh im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me like im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um yeah and most of the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was like no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was like yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channeli can already see how theres like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommyyou know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing itnow that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporinso you know i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnantall right ive been ali wong have a good night

necessarily agree with you but i appreciate very much well this is a nice place this is easily the nicest place for many miles in every direction thats how you compliment a building and shit on a town with one sentence it is odd around here as i was driving here there doesnt seem to be any difference between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here people just kind of walk in the middle of the road i love traveling and seeing all the different parts of the country i live in new york i live in a\\u2013 theres no value to your doing that at allthe old lady and the dogi live\\u2013 i live in new york i always\\u2013 like theres this old lady in my neighborhood and shes always walking her dog shes always just\\u2013 shes very old she just stands there just being old and the dog just fights gravity every day just\\u2013 the two of them its really\\u2013 the dogs got a cloudy eye and shes got a cloudy eye and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together and\\u2013 and shes always wearing like this old sweater dress i guess it was a sweater when she was like  but now its just like this sweater and her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare theyre just white with green streaks and bones sticking out her legs are awful i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by and he was like yecch no thank you i do not want those id rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit i see these two all the time and i always look at them and i always think god i hope she dies first i do i hope she dies first for her sake because i dont want her to lose the dog i dont think shell be able to handle it if she dies\\u2013 if the old lady dies first im not worried about the dog because the dog doesnt even know about the old lady this dog is aware of three inches around his head hes living in twosecond increments the second hes in and the one he just left is all he knows about but if he dies this lady shes gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has and i know hes all she has because she has him theres no\\u2013 if she had one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say good morning gladys shed be like good and just flush him down the toilet just\\u2013 poom poom the dog just keeps bumping on the drain poom  she gives up ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life ppp poommy daughter likes fishyou ever flush a pet down the toilet i had to flush my daughters fish down the toilet i came home the fish was dead she wasnt home from school yet so i just flushed the fish and thats a weird moment too cause fish live in water so you put it in the toilet floats to the bottom like yeah hes dead and then you flush and it looks like he goes wait a second aw shit i was taking a nap jesus you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house and then my daughter comes home why did he die da\\u2013 come on what am i gonna say why did he die because who gives a shit thats the reason thats the actual reason is because didnt matter that he was alive thats why hes dead he didnt know his name and he didnt love you back these are the facts about that fishs life my daughter likes fish we took her to the aquarium i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston and we were looking at this seal or sea lion i dont know which one i dont care i dont think they need to be separate things i really dont they dont care and we dont care theres like three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say ok everybody from now on seals and sea lions and walruses and\\u2013you know what\\u2013penguins are all seals now and we would all be like yeah all right fine yes whatever man anyway so were looking at this sealsea lion thing and hes looking back at us through the plexiglas and hes going\\u2013 theyre really disgusting in person most animals are when you really see them you ever go to a farm you think youre gonna see little white sheep going baa but theyre all fat and shitcolored and theyre like\\u2013 jesus that thing is awful anyway seals dont go\\u2013 they go\\u2013 my daughters like what is he saying i dont know im a slave kill methe food chainmust be awful to be other kinds of stuff you know im glad im this this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives anything else any other kind of thing youre in the food chain youre in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain i dont know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing life ends by being eaten thats how all life ends is\\u2013 every single life except human life every life ends like this aah aah aah were the only ones that get to just die old in a bed just i love you bye i mean imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else imagine if we were in the food chain it would just be another thing you gotta deal with youre already having a bad day you wake in up in the morning youre making breakfast you burn your toast and its too late to try again and your kid comes in and says beh and youre like fine and its just why you get a thing in the mail that says that your phones different and your mortgage is another company now what i dont get it then youre walking to work like why do i even bother shit goddamn it theres always fucking cheetahs at the train station stop it you think that sharks\\u2013 do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water i think theyd be bummed cause i dont think sharks are aware of that at all i think sharks think theyre slick they swim around like hey nobody has any idea whats down here and were all up here like theres totally a shark right there it wouldnt be fun being a predator either if youre a predator imagine if every time youre hungry you gotta chase a guy whos running for his life you gotta\\u2013 come on dude shit get over here and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work that would really suck thats why animals just\\u2013 they go lets do this together man you chase the parents away i am gonna eat the kid and you circle back thats why they do it like that fuck it im eating babies this is bullshit grownups aint worth the meat whoops all right all right shit goddamn it idiot this isnt a gay voice by the way its not shut up yeahcourtyard confrontationi live in new york city and its ok there i live in a nice building i never lived in a nice place before when i was growing up i had no money i mean my mom didnt didnt matter i was a child but im not used to it cause its nice theres like a pretty courtyard with flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing i dont know what is it with fountains like all fountain sculptors are pedophiles basically you cant get a fountain made without\\u2013 can you make me a fountain yes ill get started right away yes yes its finished and its just little boys pissing on the face of a greek god that looks like him a lot just piss on me forever anyway theres one of those in the courtyard of my building and my first week in the building about a year ago i went down to the courtyard for the first time and i didnt look too good you know it was a sunday morning thats my least presentable hour theres a lot of you know just stains just like you know food and me and whatever and so im sitting there so shut up ha ha ha anyway but so there i was im sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place you know theres

you have theyve been there longer if youre older youre smarter how many people here by applause are  or older  or older applaud ok thats about  people out of  heres the interesting thing theres way more i can see you theres so many more this is arizona there are way more people in that demographic but they didnt clap why cause theyre smart theyre sitting in the dark going i dont have to clap i

person and then got on a helicopter and flew away and the whole nation just watched him gogetting older makes my life betteri like getting older though because for me the kind of guy i am getting older makes my life better you know like my sex life way better at  look cause this situation is ok at  this is not a fun kind of a  to be and some people their life is better when theyre younger you know young dudes young skinny dudes best life in the world is being a young skinny dude they dont have to do anything they just show up with a big adams apple and a smelly tshirt hey im here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life so where do i\\u2013 everywhere ok cool but for guys like me this is not a fun youth it gets better id like to make one of those it gets better ads for just dumpy young guys we could use a little help a little encouragement just somebody on tv listen man i know its tough right now youre vaguely heavy with no face you have zero value on the sexual marketplace you feel invisible to the girls in school because you are but it gets better because youll all grow up and you pretty much look just like this your whole life and they dont their options start running out really fast and youre gonna be there as long as you stay relatively employed and washed youre gonna be amazing in your  youre gonna be\\u2013 youre gonna be the branch that she can grab before she hits the ground its gonna be so great it just takes time for her circumstances to match your looks but its gonna happen its gonna happen when real shit matters youre gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world its just time thats all it takes theres a formula to this its pussy plus time over income squaredeverybody has their timeeverybody has their time everybody has their time i mean not everybody there are people out there who theres just nobody for them yep people like to say things like theres someone for everyone nope not at all true and stop saying it cause its mean to people who never find anybody there are millions of people out there who weve all unanimously decided they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips even nobody touches their genitals their entire life they just wash it and then they die thats all that happens aww and if youre feeling bad for them you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart aww well go fuck one nah i didnt think so thats the one way were all mean nobody does that nobody fucks down nobody people fuck up or across some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up some guy yeah no you should im totally up yeahdating takes courageits a weird selection process that we have dating really is\\u2013 its how we evolve is dating its how we choose each other and dating is a real drag for a lot of people but i always think its a nice thing you know when i see a date im always happy when i see a couple on a date cause it means people are still trying you know you see a couple on a date it means theres still courage out there that takes courage to go on a date for both sides two very different kinds of courage the male courage traditionally speaking is that he decided to ask he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if shes gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified everything in your body is telling you just go the fuck home and jerk off dont do this but he walked up and said hi yes and shes like  no no no a second give me a second and you try to get through this membrane of you know\\u2013 and then if it works and you say you wanna go out sometime sometimes shell say yes and if she says yes thats her courage and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and illadvised and the whole species existence counts on them doing it and i dont know how they\\u2013 how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men were the numberone threat to women globally and historically were the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to women were the worst thing that ever happens to them thats true you know what our numberone threat is heart disease thats the whole thing thats it just our own heart going dude i cant\\u2013 you cant keep doing this i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart but women still\\u2013 yeah ill go out with you alone at night what are you nuts ill get in your car with you with my little shoulders hi where are we going to your death statistically how do they still do it if youre a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and youre like i hope this ones nice i hope he doesnt do what hes going to dofirst datei always\\u2013 i love when i see a date you know when you see a date you can tell its the first date cause of the way theyre walking together and shes looking up at his face trying to figure him out and hes just a mess a guy on a first date just has no actual personality hes just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each just anything no cohesive\\u2013 just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines just you know well ha ha well yes i think so too ha ha rrgh whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date thats later down the line and something has happened theres something that happens in a date that i never get to witness cause women do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly im gonna let him fuck me they just get to decide something he says and shes like that was good hes gonna fuck me later and he has no idea hes still like trying all this shit he still has no idea hes already in theretitsguys are\\u2013 we love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 and we just look at you thats what i do i just look at women i just\\u2013 like theyre you know cakes in windows i just\\u2013 i was walking in new york once and theres these two very cute women walking behind me and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other you know cause they were cute so i wanted to hear them like thats gonna help me in any way to hear their\\u2013 dont you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for like one second ok here here i go thank you its really a flaw in men that we would all do that if youre a woman you could ask any guy on planet earth could you squeeze my tit for one second and  of us will go yes of course that doesnt matter i could be doing open heart surgery yeah ok beep dont worry hes not your tits dont worry about it i dont know why we love tits so much some people say its because we breastfeed but so do women or you know baby women not grownup women dont usually\\u2013 you dont see like a  woman like a stately look\\u2013 you know like sigourney weaver like sucking milk out of a young womans tit thank you deborah ill see you tomorrow at  its not usually the thing is the elderly breastfeeding from the young except for at the end of the grapes of wrath which i dont mean to ruin that book for you but you should have read it by now i dont know if you read the grapes of wrath but thats how it ends with an old dying man sucking milk out of a young girls tits and then the book is over and youre like jesus what happened at the end there thats crazy theres no other book in that genre theres no dense historic classic that ends with a weird porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 and then anna karenina shat on his chest holy moly with that the end my god that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book ive been reading this book for three months but we do we love tits and you always know a tit you always know a tit you know like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 like a subway or like you know a sports stadium\\u2013 and youre smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you youre like thats a tit i just touched it i know that was a tit i know it because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable just to tits cause you could drive a tack in there im not gonna feel it but a tit\\u2013 through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket sweater shirt and bra somehow its a tit i touched a tit i touched a tit i touched one tit one tit thats rare to touch one tit its like a fourleaf clover usually you touch two the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didnt have permission but otherwise when tit access is granted its usually good for two tits at a time its once youre on one\\u2013 you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didnt get the second one yeah its like your moms dirty whore tit why what i said i liked it thats what i meant is that i like it i like your moms dirty whore tit and i like yours and if its up to the guy were gonna touch both tits no guy touches a tit and then goes you know what im good with the one thats fine for me everything in moderation were gonna touch both even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 yeah\\u2013 theres a bomb shit come on lets get\\u2013 come on lets get your tits out of heredivorceive seen a few tits ive seen\\u2013i dont know\\u2013  maybe i dont know i had my history in my life you know ive been divorced for five years and its been the best part of my life being divorced easily my favorite part of my life i love being divorced every year has been better than the last that is the only time i can say that about and by the way im not saying dont get married if you meet somebody fall in love and get married and then get divorced because thats the best part its the best part marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness which is divorce because you just let go and everythings fine now divorce is forever it really actually is marriage is for how long you can hack it but divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak nobody ever says  my divorce is falling apart its over i cant take it and again if youre in a good marriage stay in it if youre in the best marriage ever stay in it im just saying if you got out it would be better thats just a fact im sorry im sorry but its true everythings better my exwife and i this is the best part of our knowing each other were good coparents because we live apart and were friends our kids go to her half the week they come to me half the week and im a good father im an attentive focused and responsible father do you know why cause i get to say goodbye to these kids every week are you shitting me its like every parents fantasy who cant be a good father for half of every week no matter how bad it gets every wednesday i get

kids\\u2013 i went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 theres people holding ipads in front of their faces it looked like were all in the witness protection program like the kids cant see their parents and everybodys watching a shitty movie of something thats happening ten feet\\u2013 like look at your fucking kid the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look its totally hd why

on your\\u2013 life is short life is very short i like life i like it i feel like even if it ends up being short i got lucky to have it cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life if you have a life thats an ama\\u2013 heres your boilerplate deal with life this is basic cable what you get when you get life you get to be on earth first of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location this is earth and for trillions of miles in every direction it fucking sucks so bad its so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head cause it sucks so bad you get to be on earth and look at shit as long as youre not blind or whatever it is you get to be here you get to eat food you get to put bacon in your mouth i mean when you have bacon in your mouth it doesnt matter whos president or anything you just\\u2013 every time im eating bacon i think i could die right now and i mean it thats how good life is you get to\\u2013 you get to fuck thats free if youre smart that comes with thats part of the deal where else are you gonna get that deal you get to put your dick in there and go in and out pretty good and if youre a woman you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want anytime you want if youre a gay man you get to just fill your boyfriends ass with your dick just fill it all the way to the balls and its nice and warm and tight in there and hes your buddy if youre a lesbian you get to do all the stuff theyre doing and its a great deal you get to eat you get to fuck you get to read to kill a mockingbird its a great life so you know im not worried about it endingbehind the wheelits pretty good and ive wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i dont know you know its amazing how nasty we can get as people depending on the situation like most people are ok as long as theyre ok but if you put people in certain contexts they just change like when im in my car i have a different set of values i am the worst person i can be when im behind the wheel which is when im at my most dangerous when youre driving thats when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons and yet its the worst people get and i am the worst one time i was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and he kind of\\u2013i dont know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second and this came out of my mouth i said worthless piece of shit i mean what an indictment what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being worthless piece of shit thats somebodys son and things ive said to other people i was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 i dont remember even\\u2013 and i yelled out my window i said hey fuck you where outside of a car is that even nearly ok if you were in an elevator and you were like right next to a persons body and whatever like he leaned into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go hey fuck you worthless piece of shit no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you theres nothing you would not say to them i hope you die i said that to a person i hope you die why cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life you tested my reflexes and it worked out fine so now i hope your kids grow up motherless i mean what am i capable of id like to think that im a nice person but i dont know manif murder was legala lot of it is context theres a lot of things i wonder if the world was different like if murder was legal i might have killed a few people i dont know id love to think i would never do that but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder is the numberone thing preventing murder wed like to think its cause like i would never do that no its cause it really sucks getting caught murdering a lot if murder was legal or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 shit they had a camera there well if murder was legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderers would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you wouldnt trust somebody who didnt murder if murder was legal you wouldnt like them i never killed anybody ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep i mean not even a hooker live a life whats wrong with that guy hes like a mormon or some shit i hate those guys i think hes nice shut up janet they would just\\u2013 if murder was legal there would be a lot of murder children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids thats mostly what would happen if murder was legal you know youd go to a mall thered be like eight different moms in the mall just\\u2013 i told you to stop it you didnt listen to me just\\u2013pbbt thered be just\\u2013 youd be stepping over dead kids thered be like a new problem you have to clean up your kids when you kill them cause its gross its bad for the environment if you murder your child in a public place please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers every three feet of america put your murdered child in the red bag with a logo of a murdered kid on it next to the other logo that tells you not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave them in the bag that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row right in a row that is a compressed area of bad thoughtof course but maybeyou know you have your bad thoughts hopefully you do good things everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts hopefully the good thoughts win for me i always have both i have like the thing i believe the good thing\\u2013 thats the thing i believe\\u2013 and then theres this thing and i dont believe it but it is there its always this thing and then this thing its become a category in my brain that i call of course but maybe ill give you an example ok like of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected of course we have to segregate their food from nuts have their medication available at all times and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies of course but maybe maybe if touching a nut kills you youre supposed to die of course not of course not of course not jesus i have a nephew who has that id be devastated if something happened to him but maybe maybe if we all just do this for one year were done with nut allergies forever no of course not of course if youre fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt its a terrible tragedy of course of course but maybe maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot its not that weird maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at its a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened listen listen you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts for kids dying from nuts you applauded so youre in this with me now do you understand you dont get to cherrypick those kids did nothing to you of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened of course it is every time its happened\\u2013 black people in america jews in egypt every time a whole race of people has been enslaved its a terrible horrible thing of course but maybe maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves every single thing where you go how did they build those pyramids they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just threw chinese people in caves and blew em up and didnt give a shit what happened to them theres no end to what you can do when you dont give a fuck about particular people you can do anything thats where human greatness comes from is that were shitty people that we fuck others over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where theyre making these they jump off the fucking roof cause its a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while youre taking a shitthanks a lot folks you guys were great thank you very
